move OnTriggerEnter2D stuff from ItemAI to PlayerMovement and reference it, you dope!

make empty blocks bounce on head collision
add death animations for Jen and Thyrza
add persistent "winners" variable trigger for game completion
Fix issues where you are unable to move or jump (stuck between two tiles without enough space between them for example) == CHARACTER CONTROLLER DAY
Add sliding numbers for score
Fix "Grow" animation (this will likely fix the "stuck in ground on picking up item" issue)
